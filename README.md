# Analyzing Popularity Agnostic Factors that determine Musician Success

In this project, we explore a variety of popularity agnostic factors that could determine the 
success of musicians. The overall goal is to determine a model that can be used to predict the 
success of a musician in the short and long term. Included is the entire notebook as well as the 
write up for the project.
